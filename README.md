# StrafeAnalyzer Version 0.9
A tool that analyzes player inputs and tells the player how to improve player movement through statistics, realtime graphs, etc! :) 

This injects into the game. VAC bans are possible when the player does not include -insecure and -untrusted into their launch options. 
Obviously all accountability is assumed by the player when they choose to inject.

You can request to make a beta account through a google forms link @ https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZvBdjR4gZqw90hwvtgY_6iKO-iXUHs1068soIey2Lli8Mdg/viewform?usp=sf_link

Heres a youtube video demonstrating a few features (Version 0.9 == https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSQNXGm-n3I)

NOTE!!
Always use the correct fps_max values when using this tool. You will see inaccurate data on graphs! To fix this, you want to cap your fps to a multiple of the tickrate in order to get accurate data
